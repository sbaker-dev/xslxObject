        This object takes a read file directory as its core argument. By default file headers are turned on, but if a
        file doesn't have any file headers users can turn file headers of.

        This object has the following attributes:

        file_name: The file name of the read file minus any file extension

        sheet_column_lengths: The number of columns of data that exist with each given sheet. Keep in mind, this
        operation assumes that even if you don't have column headers, that the first row of every column does have
        content in it as this determines the length.

        sheet_row_lengths: The number of rows of data for the columns within a given sheet. Keep in mind, this operation
        assumes equal length columns and only takes the length of the first column in each sheet as the true value
        for all other columns within the sheet.

        sheet_headers: If headers are set to true, this will isolate the first row of each given column for each given
        sheet and use these values as the header value for a given column in a given sheet.

        sheet_data: This contains the data from all the sheets in a sheet-column-row format.
